# Decision Making Under Uncertainty
A high-level introduction to sequential decision making under uncertainty as part the course "Computational Intelligence" the Faculty of Architecture @ TU Delft.

## Installation

You can run the bash script `setup.sh` to create a conda env and install the required packages:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

or you can install the following packages using pip,

```bash
pip install gym==0.26.1 matplotlib numpy jupyterlab seaborn
```
(this specific version of gym is required because functionality changes in the updated versions)


## Presentations
Last year, I used [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert the jupyter notebooks to slides, so that I could run the code within the slides. However, RISE is very brittle and I cannot find the correct version of RISE that worked. Next year, I will keep the presentation and notebooks seperate and simply present using two different windows on the screen.
