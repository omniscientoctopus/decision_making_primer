# Decision Making Under Uncertainty
A high-level introduction to sequential decision making under uncertainty as part the course "Computational Intelligence" the Faculty of Architecture @ TU Delft.

## Installation

To create a conda environment and install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

It will create a conda environment `dmu_env` (name can be changed in the `environment.yml` file). 

```bash
conda activate dmu_env
```

## Presentations (for developers)

The Jupyter notebooks also serve as presentation slides via [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The required dependencies already included in `environment.yml`). To start the presentation, start a jupyter notebook,

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
and press `Alt-r` (or `‚å•-r` on mac).

For more instructions on using RISE, see [docs](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).
